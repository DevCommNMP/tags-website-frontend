                <strong>TAGS FOOTWEAR</strong> believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal
                cancellation policy. Under this policy:

              <ul className="list-unstyled">
                <li className="mb-3">
                  <strong>Cancellations:</strong> Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 2 days of placing the
                  order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
                  vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-3">
                  <strong>Perishable Items:</strong> TAGS FOOTWEAR does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers,
                  eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product delivered is
                  not good.

                <li className="mb-3">
                  <strong>Damaged or Defective Items:</strong> In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to
                  our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same
                  at his own end. This should be reported within 2 days of receipt of the products.

                  Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.
