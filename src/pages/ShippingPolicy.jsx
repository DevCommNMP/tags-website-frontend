              At TagsFootwear, we strive to provide a seamless shopping experience from the moment you place your order to the moment it
              arrives at your doorstep. Please read our detailed shipping policy below to understand how we handle shipping and delivery.
            </p>

            <h4 className="mb-2 mt-30">1. Order Processing</h4>
            <p>
              All orders are processed within 1-2 business days (excluding weekends and holidays) after receiving your order confirmation
              email. You will receive another notification when your order has shipped.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event of a high volume of orders, processing may be delayed by a few days. Please allow additional days in transit for
              delivery. If there will be a significant delay in the shipment of your order, we will contact you via email or telephone.
            </p>

            <h4 className="mb-2 mt-30">2. Shipping Rates and Delivery Estimates</h4>
            <p>
              Shipping charges for your order will be calculated and displayed at checkout. We offer various shipping options to meet your
              needs:

            <ul>
              <li>Standard Shipping: 5-7 business days</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Delivery delays can occasionally occur. Estimated delivery times are calculated from the date of shipment, not from the date
              of order.
            </p>

            <h4 className="mb-2 mt-30">3. Shipping Confirmation and Order Tracking</h4>

              number will be active within 24 hours. You can track your order through our website or the carrierâ€™s website using the
              tracking number provided.
